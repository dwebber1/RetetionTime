### RetetionTime Calulator 

* This contains two webpages.

* 1.Normal Phase
* The normal phase is an adaption of Yamazen flash chromotography algorithm.
* I wrote this so the you can insert your retention time, solvent system and it will output specfic setting for a ISCO flash chromotography machine.

* 2.Reverse Phase
* The reverse phase webpage was created for a Gilson Prep HPLC, using Water and Acetonitrile with .5% THF
* The function takes the retention time of compound on a LCMS and determines the ending percentage on the Prep HPLC for optimum seperation of peaks.
